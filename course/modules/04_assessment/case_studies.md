# Comprehensive Case Studies

## Case Study 1: Acute STEMI with Cardiogenic Shock

### Patient Presentation
**Age:** 58-year-old male  
**Chief Complaint:** "Crushing chest pain for 2 hours"  
**History:** Hypertension, diabetes, smoking history  
**Vital Signs:** BP 85/50, HR 110, RR 24, O2 sat 88% on room air

### Physical Examination
- Diaphoretic, pale, anxious
- Jugular venous distension
- Rales bilateral lower lobes
- Cool extremities
- No murmurs, rubs, or gallops

### ECG Findings
- ST elevation in leads V1-V6 (>5mm in V2-V4)
- Reciprocal ST depression in II, III, aVF
- New Q waves in V2-V3

### Laboratory Results
- Troponin I: 25.3 ng/mL (elevated)
- CK-MB: 85 ng/mL (elevated)
- BNP: 1,200 pg/mL (elevated)
- Creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL

### Discussion Points
1. What is your immediate management priority?
2. What are the indications for primary PCI vs. thrombolytic therapy?
3. How would you manage the cardiogenic shock?
4. What complications should you monitor for?

### Management Approach
- **Immediate:** Activate cardiac catheterization lab
- **Medications:** Dual antiplatelet therapy, heparin, statin
- **Shock management:** Inotropic support, consider IABP
- **Monitoring:** Continuous telemetry, invasive hemodynamics

## Case Study 2: Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response

### Patient Presentation
**Age:** 72-year-old female  
**Chief Complaint:** "Heart racing and shortness of breath"  
**History:** Heart failure, chronic kidney disease  
**Vital Signs:** BP 110/70, HR 155 (irregular), RR 28, O2 sat 92%

### ECG Findings
- Irregularly irregular rhythm
- Heart rate 140-165 bpm
- No discernible P waves
- Narrow QRS complexes
- Fibrillatory waves in V1

### Clinical Assessment
- New onset atrial fibrillation (per family)
- Mild heart failure exacerbation
- Hemodynamically stable but symptomatic

### Discussion Points
1. Rate vs. rhythm control strategy?
2. Anticoagulation considerations?
3. Choice of rate control agent?
4. When would you consider cardioversion?

### Management Options
- **Rate Control:** Metoprolol, diltiazem, or digoxin
- **Anticoagulation:** Risk stratification (CHA2DS2-VASc)
- **Monitoring:** Response to rate control, signs of instability

## Case Study 3: Cardiac Arrest with ROSC

### Scenario
**Setting:** Emergency Department  
**Patient:** 65-year-old male collapsed at home  
**Initial Rhythm:** Ventricular fibrillation  
**Downtime:** 8 minutes before CPR, 15 minutes total

### Resuscitation Details
- High-quality CPR performed
- Defibrillation x 3 (biphasic 200J)
- Epinephrine 1mg x 2 doses
- Amiodarone 300mg IV push
- ROSC achieved after 15 minutes

### Post-ROSC Management
**Vital Signs:** BP 95/60, HR 85, spontaneous respirations  
**Neurologic:** Unresponsive, no purposeful movements  
**Temperature:** 36.8°C

### Discussion Points
1. What are your post-cardiac arrest care priorities?
2. Indications for therapeutic hypothermia/TTM?
3. Neurologic prognostication timeline?
4. Family communication considerations?

### Post-ROSC Care Bundle
- **Hemodynamic:** Maintain MAP >65 mmHg
- **Respiratory:** Target SpO2 94-98%
- **Neurologic:** Consider targeted temperature management
- **Diagnostic:** 12-lead ECG, chest X-ray, labs

## Case Study 4: Bradycardia with Hemodynamic Compromise

### Patient Presentation
**Age:** 78-year-old female  
**Chief Complaint:** "Weakness and dizziness"  
**History:** Recent medication changes (beta-blocker increase)  
**Vital Signs:** BP 75/45, HR 38, RR 16, alert and oriented

### ECG Findings
- Sinus bradycardia at 38 bpm
- Normal P waves and QRS complexes
- PR interval 0.22 seconds (prolonged)
- No escape rhythms

### Symptoms
- Fatigue and weakness
- Presyncope with standing
- No chest pain or dyspnea

### Discussion Points
1. Is this hemodynamically significant bradycardia?
2. Atropine vs. transcutaneous pacing?
3. Role of chronotropic agents?
4. When to consider permanent pacing?

### Management Approach
- **Immediate:** Atropine 0.5mg IV (may repeat)
- **Prepare:** Transcutaneous pacing setup
- **Evaluate:** Reversible causes (medications, electrolytes)
- **Consult:** Cardiology for pacing evaluation

## Assessment Questions

### Multiple Choice
1. In Case 1, what is the most appropriate next step?
   a) Thrombolytic therapy
   b) Primary PCI
   c) Medical management
   d) CABG consultation

2. In Case 2, what is the CHA2DS2-VASc score?
   a) 2
   b) 3
   c) 4
   d) 5

### Critical Thinking
