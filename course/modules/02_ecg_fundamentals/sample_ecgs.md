# Sample ECG Cases for Practice

## Normal Sinus Rhythm
**Patient:** 35-year-old healthy adult  
**Rate:** 72 bpm  
**Rhythm:** Regular  
**Interpretation:** Normal sinus rhythm

### Key Features:
- P waves: Present before each QRS, upright in lead II
- PR interval: 0.16 seconds (normal)
- QRS width: 0.08 seconds (normal)
- QT interval: 0.38 seconds (normal for rate)

---

## Atrial Fibrillation
**Patient:** 68-year-old with shortness of breath  
**Rate:** 110-150 bpm (irregularly irregular)  
**Rhythm:** Irregular  
**Interpretation:** Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response

### Key Features:
- No discernible P waves
- Irregularly irregular rhythm
- Fibrillatory waves in some leads
- Narrow QRS complexes

### Clinical Considerations:
- Assess hemodynamic stability
- Consider rate vs rhythm control
- Evaluate for anticoagulation needs

## Anterior STEMI
**Patient:** 55-year-old male with crushing chest pain  
**Interpretation:** Acute anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction

### Key Features:
- ST elevation in leads V1-V6
- Reciprocal ST depression in inferior leads
- Q waves beginning to form in V2-V4
- T wave inversions in anterior leads

### Emergency Actions:
1. Activate cardiac catheterization lab
2. Administer dual antiplatelet therapy
3. Consider thrombolytic therapy if PCI unavailable
4. Monitor for complications

## Complete Heart Block
**Patient:** 72-year-old with syncope  
**Rate:** 35 bpm  
**Interpretation:** Third-degree (complete) AV block

### Key Features:
- P waves and QRS complexes completely dissociated
- More P waves than QRS complexes
- Regular P-P intervals
- Regular R-R intervals (escape rhythm)

### Management:
- Transcutaneous pacing if symptomatic
- Prepare for transvenous pacing
- Consider chronotropic agents
- Cardiology consultation for permanent pacemaker

---

## Ventricular Tachycardia
**Patient:** 60-year-old with palpitations and dizziness  
**Rate:** 180 bpm  
**Interpretation:** Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia

### Key Features:
- Wide QRS complexes (>0.12 seconds)
- Regular rhythm
- AV dissociation (when visible)
- Concordance in precordial leads

### Emergency Management:
- Assess hemodynamic stability
- If unstable: immediate synchronized cardioversion
- If stable: consider amiodarone or lidocaine
- Prepare for defibrillation

## Practice Questions

1. **Case 1:** A 45-year-old runner presents with palpitations. ECG shows a heart rate of 55 bpm with normal P waves and QRS complexes. What is your interpretation?

2. **Case 2:** An 80-year-old patient with chest pain shows ST depression in leads V4-V6 with T wave inversions. What does this suggest?

3. **Case 3:** A patient in the ICU suddenly develops a wide-complex tachycardia at 200 bpm with hemodynamic instability. What is your immediate action?

## Answer Key
1. Sinus bradycardia (likely physiologic in an athlete)
2. Posterior wall ischemia/injury (consider posterior leads V7-V9)
3. Immediate synchronized cardioversion (unstable wide-complex tachycardia)
