# Module 2: ECG Fundamentals and Interpretation

## Overview
This module focuses on the essential skills of ECG interpretation, from basic rhythm recognition to identifying life-threatening arrhythmias in emergency situations.

## Learning Outcomes
After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the electrical conduction system of the heart
